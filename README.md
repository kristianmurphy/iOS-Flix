## Flix app - iOS Development

User sees an app icon on the home screen and a styled launch screen. The user can view and scroll through a list of movies now playing in theaters, and can view the movie poster image for each movie.

User can tap a cell to see more details about a particular movie, and can tap a tab bar button to view a grid layout of Movie Posters using a CollectionView.
